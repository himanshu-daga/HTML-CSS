  <h3> Call css file in html</h3>
  <p> To call styles made in CSS in your HTML page you must use the tag: link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" </p>
  <p> 1 - Where: link rel="stylesheet" does it mean styling file </p>
  <p> 2 - And href="style.css" will be the styling file name </p>
  <p> 3 - This command will always be placed between the symbols: < > </p>
  <p>And it is very important to link it in your HTML file so that the styles work correctly :) </p>

  <p> P.S: If your CSS file is in a folder you can refer it as follows 'namefolder/style.css' </p>
